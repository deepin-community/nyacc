2022-01-30  V1.06.7
	* munge.scm: fix canize-enum-def-list

2022-01-26  V1.06.6
	* ffi-help.scm: add define to cpp-stmts forwarded to parser.
	* cxeval.scm: eval-c99-cx should return #f on non-expr tree

2022-01-11  V1.06.5
	* Updated c99/util.scm merge-inc-files! and renamed to merge-includes!
	* Align struct sizes to alignment in c99/cxeval.scm:  find-offsets.

2021-12-20  V1.06.4
	* update c99/munge to handle more cases for "keepers"

2021-12-14  V1.06.3
	* fix eval-offsetof
	* in arch-info.scm:lookup-arch, use alignof-map for alignof-dict

2021-12-10  V1.06.2
	* in eval-c99-cx, look for idents in udict

2021-12-06  V1.06.1
	* fixed issues in cxeval wrt offsetof operator
	  This includes removal of munge import.

2021-12-03  V1.06.0
	* Added location tracking to parser.
	* In lang, added support for multiple archirectures using with-arch:
	  (with-arch "i386" (sizeof-basetype "long")) => 4
 	* In c99, added work-in-progress  __builtin_offsetof operator
	* Reworked c99/munge.scm: unitize-decl, now dictize-decl.

2021-11-24  V1.05.1
	* In ffi-helper, don't process udecls with zero-length name.
	  This fixes the crash reported in guile-libyaml issue #3.

2021-09-05  V1.05.0
	* remove dependence on srfi-43, vector operations; this was
	  causing issues with some Guile versions 2.0.X
	* cleaned up c99-error exception messages in compile-ffi
	* examples/ffi/termios.ffi: added def-keepers
	* in following, $ENL = examples/nyacc/lang
	* removed $ENL/ecmascript
	* $ENL/javascript: merged body.scm into parser.scm
	* install/uninstall read-line-code now returns #<unspecified>
	* $ENL/tcl/parser.scm: fixed reading array index as number;
	  (1,2,3) was read as number, now as string
	* scripts/compile-ffi: add option -s to show includes being read
	* c99 parser def-help now adds apple dependencies
	* worked on ffi-helper per-decl usage (i.e. C-decl syntax)
	* updated "make check" to provide overall sucess/fail message

2021-05-30  V1.04.1 
	* c99/mach.scm: added _Float128 type, as absense was causing
	  ffi-helper runs to crash on #include <math.h>
	* system/ffi-help-rt.scm: change unwrap for compound type
	  to return pointer (was bytevector), so it is compatible w/
	  expected arg to procedures returned from pointer->procedure
	* c99/ffi-help.scm: change mtail->ffi-desc handle for structs
	  to unitize struct fields (via clean-and-unitize-fields)
	* above two updates closes bug #60697
 	* nyacc/lex.scm: add make-ident-keyword-reader

2021-05-28  V1.04.0 
	* in nyacc/lex.scm, changed signature of lex-generator extra-reader
	  to (ch loop) from (ch), so that user-supplied routine can loop 
	* nyacc/lang/c99/ffi-help.scm: clean up and added support for unions
	  and anonymous arrays in structs.  This needs testing.  Considering 
	  bug #60410 closed.  Anonymous structs unions are being augmented 
	  with stubbed identifiers _1 ... _N (for now).
	* Changed C99 emitted type-qual elements to use subelements instead
	  of strings: (type-qual "restrict") -> (type-qual (restrict))

2021-02-10  V1.03.7
	* in ffi-help.scm: preserve (type-qual "const"), which is later
	  used to generate constant.  Fix for bug #60474

2021-02-10  V1.03.6
	* in c99, changed how identifiers are evaluated in in dead code
	  sections (via #ifdef) are handled.  Now using skip-macro so
	  that dead macros are not evalated in case like
	    #if FOO
	    #define g_abort() abort()
	    #else
	    g_abort(void);
	    #endif

2021-02-09  V1.03.5
	* script/compile-ffi.scm: use cond-expand to catch changes to
	  compile-file between guile2 and guile3.  GUile-3 requires use
	  of new keyword arg #:optimization-level in order to get -O0.
	* the change in 1.03.4 to use 'code vs 'decl breaks the ffi-helper
	  so reversed
	* c99, in decl mode, no longer passes cpp-defines to nyacc/parser
	* ffi/glib.ffi may return 'bad c literal' because 
	  gobject/glib-types.h uses GLIB_DEPRECATED_FOR('G_TYPE_VARIANT')

2021-01-02  V1.03.4
	* c99/parser.scm: in decl mode, included files are parsed in 
	  'code mode instead of 'decl mode.  This should not affect app's
	  but deals with #if/#else where macro and function have different
	  signatures: glib's #define g_abort() vs g_abort(void).
	* c99/mach.scm: added missing case in enumerator:
	    identifier attribute-specifiers "=" constant-expression
	  used in glib/gspawn.h GSpawnError.
	* c99/munge.scm: re-worked canize-enum-def-list to deal with 
	  attributes
	* c99/ffi-help.scm: added case for 'typedef foo_t *int;'
	* c99/munge-base.scm: expand-typerefs, allow #f for declr, which
	  occurs in anonymous structs/unions.
	* lang/arch-info.scm: added lookup-arch => (sizeof-map . alignof-map)
	* c99/parser.scm: added support for _Prama() in odd places.
	* c99/mach.scm: added typeof as type specifier

2020-11-26  V1.03.3
	* cpp.scm: oops, fix not quiet right for no args -- hope this works

2020-11-26  V1.03.2
	* Added examples/nyacc/lang/java, with grammar and parser.
	  There are limitations: parameterized types and annotations
	  are not (fully) supported.  Generation of the sxml output
	  AST is partially complete.
	* lex.scm: parse C99 octals better
	* cpp.scm: variadic arg ftn w/o args sets __VA_ARGS__ to ""
	* cpp.scm: reworked collect-args for empty CPP function macros

2020-10-20  V1.03.1
	* Support was added for handling asm expressions in pretty-print-c99.
	  This uses the GNU form and will add volatile option.
	* Handling of asm in the c99 parser (c99/mach.scm) was updated to
	  clean up the output syntax trees.
	* nyacc/lang/util.scm init input-stack to '() (was #f)
	* TODO: make-lalr-parser will build parser for mach's with 
	  rrconf actions.
	* ffi-helper generated scm files now use a promise to avoid 
	  dynamic linking at compile time.
	* added make-cstr-array to ffi-help-rt (thanks rekado!);
	  updated uwrap~pointer to deal with bytevectors; previously
	  undefined unwrap~array now defined to unwrap~pointer.
	* ffi-helper generates fht-unwrap call for functions taking
	  struct-ref: see bug 59307

2020-07-19  V1.03.0
	* nyacc/lang/c99/body.scm: don't tokenize input that would be
	  unused when #ifdef'd out. Hope this makes parsing a bit faster.
	  e.g., guild compile-ffi ffi/glib speedup from 12.0 s to 6.7 s.
	* nyacc/lang/c99: merge body.scm into parser.scm
	* nyacc/lex.scm: folded make-num-reader into read-c-num and added
	  read-basic-num for other parsers (e.g., tcl).  Read-c-num will
	  check for suffixes and raise exception.  read-basic-num just
	  returns #f in this case.
	* nyacc/lang/c99/mach.scm: changed arg-expr-hack rule to use
	  proper value (a list) for the declaration-specifiers. Rule
	  was assuming the semantic value was a tagged-list object.

2020-06-01  V1.02.2
	* nyacc/lex.scm(read-c-chlit): add eof-object case for L prefix
	* nyexx/lex.scm(make-num-reader): complete rewrite: C specific
	* examples/../tcl/parser.scm: cleaned up minor errors
	* scripts/compile-ffi.scm: corrected order of dependent compiles

2020-04-10  V1.02.1
	* fixed critical bug in cxeval.scm(sizeof-mtail): case
	  to filter out comments from struct-def and union-def
	  was swapped (processing comments, skipping comp-decls)

2020-04-08  V1.02.0
	* The C99 AST, munger and ffi helper, were updated.
	  updated C99 tree tags (e.g., array-of => ary-declr), and
	  and narrowed use of abs-...-declr to lowest level. 
	* udecl->mdecl was upated to use above updates: it's more robust,
 	  and it now generates (extern) tag for non-functions, to be
	  used in a new implementation of the ffi helper (1.03?)
	* reify-decl was added to make abstract C99 declarations concrete
	* added arch-info: sizeof, alignof for multiple targets
	* eval-c99-cx now works for sizeof(type)!
	* expand-typerefs has been cleaned up: it seems more robust;
	  many new test cases were added in c99-06.test.
	* cleaned up ffi-helper ; no more warning on redefined symbols
	  from guile 3.0; more enum/defines handled now that code to
	  evaluate constant expressions is more capable
	* module/nyacc/lalr.scm (make-lalr-parser): added another keyword
	  argument `env' to specify the enviornment for generating
	  the parser actions (default, @code{(current-module))})
	* Added #:env keyword option to make-lalr-parser.  This is where
	  the quoted actions are evaluated.
	* Added FH uintptr_t intptr_t defines for use w/ guile-2.0.
	* compile-ffi does not now produce .scm file on failure or ^C

2020-03-13  V1.01.2
	* fixed bug #57911, compile-ffi fails to parse function attributes 
	  preceded by *; added production rule to pointer:
	   ("*" attribute-specifiers ($$ '(pointer)))
	* updated example tcl and mlang code
	* fixed lex to accept F in 1.0e-3F;
	* c99 cpp now handles blank #-line

2020-02-22  V1.01.1 (V1.01.0 not released)
	* read-only struct-vable fields in ffi-helper changed to writable:
	  guile 3.0 deprecates read-only fields
	* Split expand-typerefs from c99/munge.scm into c99/munge-base.scm.
	  This should exliminate the warning about undefined expand-typerefs.
	* Eliminated deprecated symbols from c99/munge.scm: udecl->mspec
	  udecl->mspec/comm mspec->udecl tree->udict tree->udict/deep
	  declr->ident match-decl match-comp-decl match-param-decl
	  expand-decl-typerefs fix-fields.
	* now installing examples in $(DATADIR)/nyacc/examples
	* updated configure.ac to be guix-compatible
	* changed configure : removed guile.m4 pkg.m4 nyacc.m4

2020-01-07  V1.00.2
	* updated configure scripts to handle 2.0.14 via
	  --with-guile=/path/to/guile

2019-12-29  V1.00.1
	* in nyacc/util.scm, changed a letrec* to letrec
	* in nyacc/lang/util.scm, changed a letrec* to let*
	* updated all Makefile.in for autoconf conventions, using
	  abs_top_builddir and abs_top_srcdir
	* added test-suite/Makefile.in to replace lower level versions

2019-12-23  V1.00.0
	* Makefiles now use "$(MAKE)" instead of "make"
	* changed order of udict, ddict arguments to canize-enum-def-list
	* removed hacks from eval-cpp-expr prev used by canize-enum-def-list
	* cleaned up cxeval failures

2019-12-15  V0.99.3
	* in ffi-help.scm, filter "libm" from being added to dynamic-link:
	  on Ubuntu libm.so is a text file which referneces another libm.so;
	  dlopen() does not follow the reference, so just filter out since it
	  is already linked into guile
	* the C parser still breaks where typedefs are used otherwise, like
	    typedef int t; int foo(t *t);  // in libxlsxwriter
	* updated canize-enum-defs to use c99-eval-cx instead of cpp-eval
	  which was a hack; also cleaned up canize to work with comments
	  as attributes instead of elements; added test case

2019-10-23  V0.99.2 release
	* 0.99.1 fix broke things: __extension__ is not function macro
	* ffi-help does not load libm now (ubuntu bug?)

2019-10-19  V0.99.1 release
	* fixed nyacc/lang/c99/util.scm: in c99-def-help function macro
	  aliases changed from "__foo=__foo__" to "__foo(X)=__foo__(X)"

2019-07-20  V0.99.0 release
	* added fixed-point types to C99 parser
	  http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2001/n1290.pdf
	  make-num-reader accepts 0.25hr uhr r ur lr ulr hk uhk k uk lk ulk

	* cleaned up documentation

2019-05-30  V0.94.0 release
	* removed export statment from c99/util.scm

	* started C99 documentation

	* fixed some version number errors

2019-05-30  V0.93.0 release
	* reworked configure and Makefile.in files to detect doc
	  install dirs;
  
	* this CPP feature now works: #define /* hello */ abc 123

	* fixed issue in c99/eval-cpp-incl where #f was ending up in
	  output if no include file found

2019-04-02  V0.92.0 release
	
	* The distribution has been converted to using autoconf, but
	  without automake, which brings in a lot of rubble, IMO.

	* Fixed bug in the ffi-helper that was genering bad code for
	  unions.

2019-01-18  V0.91.0 release

	* module/nyacc/parse.scm (dmsg/n): added ntab information; so
	debug is now more informative:
	OLD:
	  state 99, token 33 => shift, goto 300
	NEW:
	  state 99, token additive-expression => shift, goto 300

	* ffi-help: converting composite literal to constant is no longer
	a fatal error

	* module/nyacc/lang/c99/cxeval.scm (eval-c99-cx): added case for
	comp-lit; made failure throw c99-error instead of calling error

	* module/nyacc/lang/c99/ffi-help.scm: updated error handling when
	cannot convert enum or #defined argument to a constant

2018-11-29  V0.90.0 release

	* module/nyacc/lang/c99/mach.scm (c99-spec): K&R function
	definitions have been removed, since conflict with __attribute__,
	as in: int foo(x) __attribute__ ((__bar__)) int x; { ... };
	Is attribute associated with declarator or declaration-specifiers?

	* update Major overhaul of __attribute__ handling in C99 parser

	* update merged nx-matlab updates from nxdev branch; added fix
	for nyacc/lex.scm to parse #xffff00000


	* update reworked the nyacc parser.scm file (see nyacc/ChangeLog);
	instead of separate parsers for interactive and non-interactive
	there is now one make-lalr-parser with optional #:interactive
	keyword argument; also added #:skip-if-unexp for skipping
	unexpected tokens (e.g., for comments -- this is useful);

	* update moved code from c99/xparser.scm into c99/parser.scm and
	deleted c99/xparser

	* update cleaned up C99 parser set up; the mapping between parse
	tables and the lexical analyzer setup was brittle; cleaned up
	circular dependency between the parser and lexical analyzer using
	letrec; see c99/parser.scm and c99/body.scm

	new release 0.85.0
	* changed the integrated hashed vs unhashed parser was split into
	/sym parsers for unhashed and /num for hashed.
	* updated interactive parsers, getting ready to and integrate file
	and interactive parsers, and overhaul C99 parser setup
